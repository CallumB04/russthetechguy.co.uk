                    <p>Was absolutely gutted when my daughter dropped her iPad 2 weeks before we 
                    were due to go abroad! I messaged Russ and service was so <strong>quick and smooth</strong> from 
                    start to finish, after having a bad experience with a shop in Maidstone town I 
                    was hesitant but the <strong>iPad looks brand new again</strong> so happy with it! Cheap aswell 
                    <strong>half the price</strong> of what the shops in town wanted.</p>

                    <p>Russ was absolutely brilliant on helping out with my xbox controllers as they weren't 
                    working properly he <strong>went beyond to what he needed</strong> to repair them. 
                    <strong>Very good on pricing</strong> and even better we will have someone to go to in the 
                    romney area soon for any of ur techs and gadgets problem's once he moves down here 
                    permanently.</p>

                    <p><strong>Brilliant service</strong> Russell provides I must say, I took my mums Bose wave 
                    radio to him after it stopped working altogether and thinking it was ready to dispose 
                    of and <strong>with his knowledge</strong> of these sort of things it was <strong>repaired 
                    and very good price</strong>, my mums over the moon she has her stereo back up and 
                    running, it's so good to know his just round the corner too, many thanks Russell.</p>

                    <p>Russ has been repairing phones for us for a while I <strong>honestly wouldn‚Äôt use anyone else</strong>
                    .. my daughter went to a shop in Maidstone to have a quick repair this back fired majorly the shop left 
                    lots of parts out and it stopped working <strong>spoke to Russ and he come to the rescue</strong> again.. 
                    I‚Äôd <strong>highly recommended Russ</strong> never go to a shop in Maidstone town again.</p>

                    I thought was beyond repair</strong>, by replacing & re soldering the battery compartment springs 
                    didn't know this was possible, local man in new Romney. ropped toy off, went shopping, messaged me when 
                    done. Great <strong>fair prices & fab service would certainly recommend</strong>.</p>
